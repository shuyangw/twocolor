# Twocolor
Program to determine if an input graph is bipartite or not.  

If it is bipartite, then the program outputs a valid coloring of the vertices.
If not, then the output is an odd cycle that violates the bipartite graph properties.

To run, download TwoColor.jar and type into command line:
java -jar TwoColor.jar "input file" "output file"
Note: input file must have the same format as the test files located in the testfiles directory.
